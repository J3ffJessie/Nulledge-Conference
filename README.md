# Nulledge Landing Page

Independent conference for platform knowledge sharing that is practical and actual knowledge that can be used daily in our work. This is not a sales pitch of the latest and greatest modules or capabilities, but more a conference to gain insight and tips on best practices and how to use the tools that are built into the platform to accomplish end goals for your clients.

## Getting Started

3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

## A few notes

This is set up to use a Google sheet to define some content on the home page... that probably isn't as important... and should be taken out at some point.

Also this is setup to use Ringcental's public endpoints for sessions and speakers... which is probably not ideal for a public facing site. So that should be changed at some point as well.
